    "Previously, we looked at how to implement a stack using an array. While that approach does work, we saw that it raises some concerns with time complexity. For example, if we exceed the capacity of the array, we have to go through the laborious process of creating a new array and moving over all the elements from the old array.\n",

Then hide the solution, take a short break, and see if you can remember how to do it. Throughout this course, you will find yourself building on concepts you learned earlier. Whenever this is the case, it's good to take this same approach (try to remember, then check the solution, then hide the solution and try to remember again). This effort will help the ideas stick better."
